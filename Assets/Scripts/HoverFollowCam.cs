	//We have two orders of business, firstly we must have the camera always be moving to camPos, this will be triggered when it is a certain distance away from camPos
	//Further down the line, we will have to deal with walls and things, how do we avoid the camera getting thrown behind a wall, for this we will have to write a detection system on the camera for when it is approaching
